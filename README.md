# Documenting My Journey To Become A Blockchain Developer

### *"The idea of “documenting” instead of “creating” is an absolute monster..." - Gary Vee*

## Background

The idea of documenting my journey to become a blockchain developer is inspired by these :

* [100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) by Alexander Kallaway. The difference is, it's not only to change a habit but to go all in until you secure the job with the title you want.
* [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig.
* [Document Don't Create](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/) by Gary Vaynerchuk.

From those three resources I realized that I have to document my journey to become a blockchain developer.
