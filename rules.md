# Rules of documenting my journey

## Main Commitment
### *I will learn anything that can help me to become a blockchain developer.*

## Additional Rules
1. I don't have to do it every day. But, I have to keep counting how many days I've been learning.
2. I will post about my progress on any social media I choose (it could be Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc).
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. The progress can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post, or anything I learn that day.
