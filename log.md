# Documenting My Journey - Log

### Day 101: September 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read how to create a Voting smart contract.

**Thoughts:** Well, I actually understand what the code is saying. Now it's time to practice it. I think I haven't really good at connecting the backend to the frontend. I will also take time to learn more about frontend.

**Note:** In case you wonder why I started from DAY 101, I've been finished my 100DaysOfCode, and planning to continue with this. You can check [my 100DaysOfCode here](https://www.instagram.com/yusak_man/).
